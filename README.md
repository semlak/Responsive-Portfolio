# Repsponsive-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio-type site I developed to satisfy requirements for an deliverable for a course I'm taking. I plan to convert it to an actual professional portfolio website, but as it exists it is not ready.

The site is currently static with no server requirements beyond standard html/css/javascript delivery. It is styled to be responsive, similar to Bootstrap, but without using that framework and relying on media queries and my own css. The form in the contact.html page does not actually submit data.
